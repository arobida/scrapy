# Page Scraper
just a simple node html scraper why?
good question: I built it to make copies of pages I would like to rebuild and show to clients. It will go to that page read the html and make a exact copy to your desktop! I know there are extensions that do this but... its nodejs and its a fast and zippy cli app so why not?

# Install
Just install with:
```javascript
npm i -g afr-scrapy
```

# Just Scrape it!

Use it by giving it a url with the -c flag
Like so:
```javascript
scrape -c https://google.com
```
